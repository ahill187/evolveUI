# evolveUI

This is the front end for an application for open scientific research. Currently, there is no good, searchable online database for finding scientific literature.
Google Scholar is probably the best search tool available, but the advanced options are very limited. The idea is to create something like Arxiv/BioArxiv,
but add a better UI, allow for the creation of user accounts, and create a standard data format for scientific papers.
